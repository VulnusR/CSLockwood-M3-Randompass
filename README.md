## Randompass

Randompass is a random password generator providing a random password based on certain user inputs like lower/upper case, numbers, and special characters. It also allows users to define the length of the string they would like to generate from a range of 8 to 124.

Randompass is a subset of the UCLA bootcamp work modules. 
The UCLA bootcamp provides the project's userstory & Acceptance Criteria.
